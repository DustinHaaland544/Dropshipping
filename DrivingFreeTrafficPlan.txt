Driving Free Traffic - Your Content Plan 

1. Keep in mind...

- Free traffic is difficult to scale

- Not a huge traffic source 

- Essential for understanding your ideal customer 

- And... it will give you your first sales!


2. What revenue could you expect?

- This is targeted warm traffic 

- Can convert up to 10% 

- 1000 visitors per month = $1-2000/month profit


3. Plan carefully to avoid overwhelm 

- Start with 1 community, 3 or 4 maximum

- Spend 15 minutes per day per community

- Make 1 blog post per week per community 

- Keep refining your ideal customers 


4. When to stop?

- Probably never

- When low cost or paid traffic methods dominate 

- Not before you understand your ideal customers
