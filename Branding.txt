- Let's imagine that there are two stores in the real world. They sell exactly the same products for exactly the same prices. But one of the store owners are really
grumpy and miserable and the other tore owner is super happy and provides really great customer service. Which one of those are you going to buy from? Ofcourse! 
You're going to go for who is happy and provides great customer service and not only that you're also going to recommend that your friends go there also. 

This simple example demonstrates the power of personality. How you layout your site? How you describe your products? How you develop your blog? And ofcourse
How you deal with customer service? Really does define you and your brand. Don't be afraid to let your personality shine through.
