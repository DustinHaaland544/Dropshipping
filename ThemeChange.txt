Switching to a new Shopify theme does typically mean you’ll have to reconfigure certain elements, especially those specific to the theme design, like color 
schemes, fonts, layout settings, and some customization options unique to the old theme. However, some core aspects of your store won't change:

1. Products, Collections, and Menus: These are unaffected by a theme change and will stay the same.

2. Pages and Blog Posts: Any content you’ve added, like pages (e.g., FAQ page) and blog posts, will carry over.

3. Navigation Structure: The menu structure should remain as is, although you may need to adjust links if the new theme handles menus differently.

4. Apps and App Settings: Apps stay installed, but any theme-specific placements of app elements may need re-integration.

5. Custom Code: If you’ve added custom code to the old theme (like liquid code for the Catalog menu or style changes), those will not transfer. You’d need to 
reapply them to the new theme.

It’s best to preview the new theme and make note of any adjustments you may need to redo. Some design work might be required, but with a clear checklist, the 
transition can go smoothly.
