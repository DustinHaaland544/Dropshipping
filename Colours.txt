For a kitchen product-focused Shopify store like Leavsley, consider choosing a color theme that evokes freshness, cleanliness, and energy. 

Here's a breakdown of suitable colors and their psychological impact:

1. Green

- Why? Green represents freshness, health, and natural ingredients—qualities often associated with food and kitchens.

- How to Use: Use lighter shades of green for backgrounds and accents to give a clean and modern feel. Pair with white for a crisp, minimalist look.

2. Orange

- Why? Orange is energetic and appetizing, stimulating both attention and hunger. It conveys friendliness and enthusiasm.

- How to Use: Use orange sparingly as an accent color (e.g., buttons or headers) to avoid overwhelming the page.

3. Blue

- Why? Blue evokes trust and cleanliness, essential for selling kitchen items. While it’s less commonly associated with food, lighter blues can suggest water and 
hygiene.

- How to Use: Pair light blue with white or gray to create a calming, professional feel.

4. Yellow

- Why? Yellow conveys optimism and energy, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.

- How to Use: Like orange, use yellow sparingly for call-to-action buttons or banners to draw attention without overpowering.

5. Neutral Tones (White, Beige, Gray)

- Why? Neutral tones create a clean, modern, and professional backdrop for your products. They’re versatile and pair well with any of the above colors.

- How to Use: Use these as base colors, allowing more vibrant shades to pop.

Suggested Theme Combination:

- Primary: Green or Blue

- Accent: Orange or Yellow

- Neutral: White or Light Gray

This combination balances freshness, energy, and professionalism, resonating well with customers looking for high-quality kitchen items.
