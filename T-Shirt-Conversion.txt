STEP 1: Prepare Your Shopify Store for the Pivot

- If you want to start fresh, you can open a new Shopify store with a new domain/brand for your t-shirt business.

2. Remove Old Kitchen Product Listings

- Go to Products > All Products, and remove any kitchen-related items.

- Also remove kitchen-related collections, tags, and menus under Online Store > Navigation.

3. Update Store Branding

- Rename your store, update the logo, and change your theme/design to reflect the new niche.

- Update your About Us page to reflect your passion and vision for your t-shirt brand.

STEP 2: Set Up Print-On-Demand with Printify

- Go to Printify and sign up for an account.

2. Connect Printify to Shopify

- In Printify dashboard: Go to Manage Stores > Add New Store > Shopify.

3. Browse T-Shirt Products

In Printify, explore:

- Plain t-shirts from brands like Bella+Canvas, Gildan, AS Colour, etc.

Here are some good options to consider:

Gildan 5000	                         Same	                                  Affordable, good for bulk/basic designs
AS Colour 5001	                     Prima Printing	                        High quality, more premium cost

STEP 3: Design Your T-Shirts

1. Create Your Own Designs

Use tools like:

- Canva

- Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop

- MidJourney (AI art) or ask me to help you generate design ideas

2. Upload Your Designs to Printify

- Choose a blank t-shirt.

- Use Printify’s built-in editor to place your design on the shirt.

- Preview how it looks.

- Choose sizes, colors, and pricing.

- Publish the product directly to your Shopify store.

STEP 4: Optimize Your Store for Sales
1. Structure Your Store Navigation
Add product categories: Men’s Tees, Women’s Tees, Funny Tees, Motivational, etc.

Create clear, clean menus and product filters.

2. Set Up High-Converting Product Pages
Include clear mockups from Printify

Add benefit-driven descriptions (e.g., soft cotton, durable print)

Size guide and care instructions

Reviews section (can add dummy reviews to start using apps like Loox)

3. Install Useful Shopify Apps

- Printify (for product creation/fulfillment)

- Loox or Judge.me (for reviews)

STEP 5: Marketing & Launch

1. Set Up Social Media Pages

- Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest work great for t-shirt brands.

- Start posting mockups, behind-the-scenes, design ideas, lifestyle photos.

2. Email Marketing

- Set up abandoned cart flows and welcome emails using Klaviyo or Shopify Email.

3. Paid Ads (Once You Have a Few Sales)
