If you're looking to pause your Shopify store temporarily and avoid standard charges, Shopify offers two main options:

Pause and Build Plan: This plan allows you to keep the store accessible for a reduced fee (usually around $9/month). Customers can't 
make purchases, but you can still access the admin panel, manage inventory, and work on the store design. This is a good option if 
you plan to return to the store soon and want to keep some access for maintenance.

Full Store Deactivation: If you deactivate your store entirely, it will be closed, and you won’t be billed for the subscription anymore. 
However, you’ll lose access to the admin dashboard, and the store data will be archived. Shopify keeps this data for a limited time (usually
2 years), so you can re-open later, but you won’t have direct access to it until you reactivate.

If cost-saving is your main concern and you're unsure when you’ll be ready to return, full deactivation is the best way to avoid charges altogether. 
If you’d like to keep a minimal presence with backend access, the Pause and Build option might work better.

Since you’re on an annual plan with a promotional rate, switching to the Pause and Build plan should adjust your billing cycle rather than immediately
charging the full annual amount. Here’s how it typically works:

Billing Suspension for Annual Plans: When you switch to the Pause and Build plan, Shopify usually pauses your current annual billing, effectively 
"freezing" the remainder of your yearly plan. Instead, they’ll charge you the $9/month until you’re ready to return.

Resuming Full Billing: When you unpause your store and go back to a regular plan, Shopify will then reinstate your annual billing cycle. They’ll 
resume the remaining balance based on the time left on your original plan, without an immediate full $453 charge unless your yearly cycle has ended.

I recommend confirming this with Shopify’s support to ensure your annual plan adjusts correctly, as they can verify your specific promotional terms.
