That sounds like a solid and creative business plan! You're combining custom design, AI tools, and print-on-demand (POD) to create a low-maintenance, scalable business. 

Here's a structured framework to help you get started step-by-step:

Business Framework for Your Mug Store

1. Planning & Preparation

- Niche & Theme Strategy

  - Start broad with categories like:

    - Pop Culture (e.g., Marvel-style)

    - Occasions (Valentine‚Äôs, Mother‚Äôs/Father‚Äôs Day, Birthdays)

    - Motivational Quotes

    - Funny/Sarcastic Sayings

    - Personalized name/date mugs

  - Keep copyright laws in mind‚Äîdon't use copyrighted logos (e.g., Marvel/Deadpool) unless you have a license. Use inspiration instead (e.g., parody or fan art with a twist).

2. Design Phase

- Tools

    - Use Midjourney, Ideogram, or Canva AI to generate custom artwork or typography for your mugs.

    - Save your designs in high resolution (300 DPI) with transparent backgrounds (PNG) for better mug printing.

- Organization

    - Categorize your designs (e.g., ‚ÄúValentine's,‚Äù ‚ÄúFor Dad,‚Äù ‚ÄúGeek Culture‚Äù) into folders.

    - Use a consistent mockup template to display them attractively.

3. Set Up Shopify Store

- Theme Selection

    - Choose a clean, product-focused theme (e.g., ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù or ‚ÄúCraft‚Äù).

    - Add your store link in the bio and set up a "Shop Now" button that links to your store.

  - Product Posts

    - For each mug, create a Facebook post with:

      - Mockup image

      - CTA (Call to Action): "Click to Order üëá"

      - Product link (direct Shopify link to the product page)
